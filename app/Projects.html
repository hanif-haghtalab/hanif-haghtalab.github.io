          When the final goal is not defined as a form of physical construction,
          the architect acts as a consultant who tries to offer suggestions in response 
          to current demands.With this in mind,we stablished the process of design 
          through generative methods instead of creating the final output.
          Art galleries are almost like flat exhibition,so programmed minimal surfaces 
          enable the client to shape the space freely with easy locating of control points and sizes as needed.
          Considering that most of built environments are designed in cryptovoxel with rigid and inflexible boundaries and edges,our team 
          decided to design a flexible sculptural structure.

        <p>
          For a long time, the boundary between reality and imagination, between what is in our minds and what we see before our eyes, was explicitly recognizable for us. And the means we used to recognize this boundary were our senses and perception. Gradually, the media became so powerful that could have created another world for us in which our senses were teased in different ways. The diverse mass media and simulated worlds have cast doubt on whether what we have known so far, is the true reality?
We want to know how the mass media affect our understanding of reality and hasn't the reality been distorted from the very beginning? Here we break down all our perceptions of reality in order to make some space for the presence of reality itself by creating holes. we aim to find another reality behind our current hyper-reality. The reality that in itself is another hyper-reality because the media changes it in any case. Music:Omid Zolfaghari Visual:Hanif Haghtalab

       If we consider both clothing and architecture as an extension of our body .then, how can our body expand into the world wide web? how can digital facilities interpret our senses?
       This project aims to explore the different ways of communication in the digital realm.
       With variety of sensors and technologies which are invented around the world everyday,how can our brain develop and process data which is not come from our main senses?
       With the help pf new technologies and hardwares like image processing ,sound analysis, infrared technology, depth cameras and AI how can we have better communications and share our thoughts more deeply between each other?

        <p>
         This project was defined with the aim of creating a traditional residence in the historical context of Shiraz, Sang-e-Siah neighborhood, 
         between five National Registered Buildings from Ilkhani, Zandeih, Qajar and Pahlavi historical periods.
         In recent years, contextual rehabilitation projects have been developed based on the demolition and aggregation strategies,
         which gradually eliminate the proportions of void and mass,
         the geometric and communication system of passages and the structure of a significant part of historical context by eradicating fine-grained structures and passages, creating large-scale projects and constructing streets.

        <p>
          This was my project as the output of one week workshop'Bio Inspired Masks' by Behnaz Farahi.
          The Burqa is a type of clothing worn by women in south of Iran and also Arabic countries.
          There are many kinds of Burqa all around the Middle East.
          Some of them are covored with lots of small and shiny components and those which are made
          with specific textile changing their colors according to the direction of light inspired me the most.
          Their components and changeable colors reminded me of similar patterns in feathers of birds and scales of fishes and snakes.

          Moqarnas is an architectural element that was achieved through extension of 2D patterns into 3rd dimention.
          In the past,geometrical patters were created with compass and a ruler.
          Drawing hexagonal grids with this method gave us a generative underlying algorithm that enables us to draw infinite arbitrary Moqarnases patterns.
          AR technology would be a good way to study the potentials of geometrical patterns for expansion into higher dimentions.
